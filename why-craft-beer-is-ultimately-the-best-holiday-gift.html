                        Why Craft Beer is Ultimately the Best Holiday Gift

                        There are ultimately 4 stages holiday shoppers (aka you) go through each year.
                        Maybe you're lucky and can knock out your list early, but for the rest of us out there...brace
                        yourself for the season of trying to find a great,
                        personal, and thoughtful Holiday Gift for the person who “doesn't need anything”. We all know at
                        least one of them.
                        So, my friends, we give you the 4 stages you'll probably be going through before the month is
                        over.
                        The good news? At least you're not going through it alone and you'll arrive at the ideal Holiday
                        Gift for practically everyone on your list.

                    <h3 class="blog__article--extended-subheader">Stage One: Seasonal Bliss</h3>
                    <p class="blog__article--extended-content">
                        Ahh, the good old days. The brief period right after Thanksgiving when you switch out the Fall
                        decorations for holiday lights and pine garnishes,
                        light the cinnamon candles and wait in giddy anticipation for the snow, carolers and festivities
                        to begin. It’s a lovely time to be alive, isn't it?
                        The air is crisp, people seem more joyous and even your seasonal brews taste better. But, don’t
                        settle in quite yet.
                        It’s like most light-hearted family comedies, the movie starts out nice and calm, joyous even,
                        but those of us watching on only know there’s bound
                        to be something or someone who shakes each and every beer bottle, sending your mouthwatering
                        craft beer exploding in your face.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog__article--extended-subheader">Stage Two: Realization</h3>
                    <p class="blog__article--extended-content">
                        So you’ve found yourself ‘starting early’ with your holiday shopping and go out perusing the
                        stores, taking in the wonderful atmosphere.
                        Your Seasonal Bliss still has you feeling nice and warm inside but there’s something else
                        creeping in that you can’t quite shake: enter the realization phase.
                        Yep, a funny little thing that keeps reminding you that while it may be the second week of
                        December, you’re actually running out of time.
                        You’re thinking “But the holidays are so far away...” but are they? Are they really? Let’s put
                        it into perspective:You had a six-pack of beer,
                        you drink one or two and things are merry. But by the end of the third you suddenly become aware
                        of the fact that you only have 3 left...
                        you had all the beer in the world a few hours ago, but now there's only half left.This starts a
                        snowball effect, causing you to start counting down the days
                        for when items need to be bought and shipped, what is being sent to you versus to your gift
                        recipient, who’s handling the shipping, wrapping, the holiday recipes,
                        who’s coming to visit, etc.Ok, STOP. Let’s pause there.
                        Take a breather, open another bottle of craft beer, or maybe two. Bring your heart rate down.
                        You're fine! We’re only in Stage Two.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="blog__article--extended-subheader">Stage Three: Uh-oh</h3>
                    <p class="blog__article--extended-content">
                        You’re down to the wire and it’s go-time! The ‘buy things early’ plan didn’t go so well and
                        you’re out buying last minute gifts.
                        But you still want them to be thoughtful and something your friends and loved ones’ will
                        thoroughly enjoy.
                        Stumped, you stop in at a bar for lunch - more like stiff-armed your way through the crowds of
                        people playing bumper cars with their shopping bags - but I digress.
                        At the bar you order your favorite craft beer. Watching the carbonation rise and smiling while
                        you take you first glorious sip, it hits you - CRAFT BEER!
                        It’s the one thing that perhaps everyone on your gift list loves, is passionate about, or maybe
                        wants to learn more about.
                        So now you have the dilemma of buying a Craft Beer Gift for all of your Craft Beer Enthusiast
                        friends and family.
                        But what do you get when they all have different style preferences, levels of Beer-geekiness and
                        know-how?We’ll give you some clues:
                        You order it online, it arrives in a big brown box from far-away places, tastes delicious, and
                        holds the answers to all of life’s unanswered questions...
                        The Original Craft Beer Club Monthly Subscription. Boom. Holiday. List. Done.You’re welcome.

                    <h3 class="blog__article--extended-subheader">Stage Four: Seasonal Euphoria</h3>
                    <p class="blog__article--extended-content">
                        Now that you have your gift list figured out, it’s time to sit back, relax and let the Seasonal
                        Euphoria wash over you - and trust us, it’s way better than
                        Stage One’s silly blissfulness. You’ve successfully managed to get a thoughtful, tasty gift and
                        best of all, it comes every month!
                        Your gift recipient has no chance of forgetting how much you care well after the holidays are
                        over.Order online, and let someone else (aka us) take care of
                        finding the monthly breweries and beer styles, then figure out the logistics and delivery.
                        All you have to do is revel in the holiday spirit, frolic in the snow and wait for them to open
                        their best Holiday Craft Beer Gift.
